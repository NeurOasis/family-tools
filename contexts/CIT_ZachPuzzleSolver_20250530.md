## 🎯 Project Overview

```
Project: NINYE F-Word Puzzle Solver (Zach's Tool)
Current Version: v1.0 (Single LCARS Interface)
Date: 20250530
Status: Migration from GARDEN to focused family-tools
Repository: https://github.com/NeurOasis/family-tools
Path: /zach-puzzle-solver/

## 🧩 **Context: The NINYE Puzzle**

### **The Challenge:**
- NINYE posted a video with a password puzzle 2+ years ago
- Single word, starts with "F", no numbers
- 2,000,000+ comments with 173 unique F-word attempts
- 0% success rate - no one has solved it

### **Our Discovery:**
After analyzing 2M comments, we found F-words that NINYE uses in his own content that NO ONE has tried:
- **FINITE** - "Finite is time/resources"
- **FACADE** - "Facade is fake/illusion"
- **FERVOR** - "Fervor is passion"
- **FRENZY** - "The frenzy continues"
- **FRACTAL** - "Fractal patterns everywhere"

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Single Page LCARS Application**
- **Framework:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (GARDEN NodePad philosophy)
- **UI:** Full LCARS Star Trek interface
- **Data:** 2M comment analysis embedded
- **Deployment:** Vercel static hosting

### **Core Features:**
1. **Main Dashboard** - Word trying interface
2. **Analysis Panel** - 2M comment insights (slide-out)
3. **Strategy Guide** - Dockable side panel
4. **Pattern Analyzer** - Overlay visualization
5. **Export System** - Track attempts and findings

### **Design Principles:**
- No page navigation - everything in one interface
- Dynamic panels that slide/dock/overlay
- Multi-column support for simultaneous activities
- LCARS aesthetic throughout
- Mobile responsive

## 📊 **Data Architecture**

### **2M Comment Analysis:**
```json
{
  "total_analyzed": 2000000,
  "failed_words": {
    "FUTURE": 450000,
    "FAMILY": 125000,
    // ... 171 more
  },
  "ninye_vocabulary": {
    "FINITE": {"count": 0, "context": "Finite is time/resources"},
    "FACADE": {"count": 0, "context": "Facade is fake/illusion"},
    // ... critical discoveries
  },
  "patterns": {
    "philosophical_terms": ["FINITE", "FACADE", "FERVOR"],
    "untried_sophisticated": ["FECUND", "FETTLE", "FIASCO"]
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **User Journey**

1. **Arrives at tool** - Sees critical discoveries immediately
2. **Tries words** - One-click copy functionality
3. **Explores patterns** - Can open analysis panels
4. **Reads strategy** - Side dock for guidance
5. **Tracks attempts** - Local storage persistence
