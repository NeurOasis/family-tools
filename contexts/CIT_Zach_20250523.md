- **Primary Profile**: Autism with Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA)
- **Location**: Annapolis, Maryland area
- **Living Situation**: Divorced parents, shared custody

## üß† Core PDA Characteristics

### Control and Autonomy
- **Control Definition**: Extremely narrow - anything presented as a request/demand becomes "out of his control"
- **PDA Response**: Even activities he wants to do become challenging if framed as something he "should" or "needs" to do
- **Autonomy Needs**: Must feel like choices and activities originate from him

### Communication Patterns
- **When Frustrated**: Uses hurtful language ("Daddy, shut up", "It's your fault")
- **Emotional Regulation**: Goes from 0-60 very quickly with little warning
- **Processing Style**: Doesn't express emotions in the moment - reactive rather than reflective
- **Interruption Sensitivity**: Hates being interrupted, especially during screen time

- **Multiple Valid Options**: All choices should be genuinely acceptable outcomes
- **Escape Routes**: Always have ways to change plans without "failure"
- **Collaborative Language**: "What do you think about..." instead of "Let's do..."

### Time Management
- **Visual Time Indicators**: Need non-intrusive way to show time remaining
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Build in extra time and alternative endpoints
- **Natural Transitions**: Look for organic stopping points rather than imposed time limits
- **Buffer Activities**: Have low-key transition activities ready
